           <p> A <span class="adjective" ></span> man went out to buy <span class="accessory"></span> at the <span class="place"></span>. His name was <span class="person"></span>. On his way there, an expensive looking vehicle drove past him. Unfortunately, <span class="person"></span> was walking past a puddle at that moment. The vehicle which was a <span class="brand"></span> didn't slow down enough on reaching the puddle causing the dirty water to splash on his white <span class="items"></span>. <span class="person"></span> was annoyed at this. The <span class="brand"></span> slowed to a halt a few feet away from him and the driver got out. To <span class="person"></span>'s amazement, the driver was <span class="celebrity"></span>.</p><p> <span class="celebrity"></span> apologized profusely for not being careful and offered to buy him new <span class="items"></span>, seeing the ones <span class="person"></span> was wearing had been stained. <span class="person"></span> who was starstruck, politely refused. When <span class="celebrity"></span> realized <span class="person"></span> would not accept buying him new <span class="items"></span>, he offered him a lift in his <span class="brand"></span> to which <span class="person"></span> accepted. It was an amazing encounter <span class="person"></span> would never forget.</p>
